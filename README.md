# VSDBabySoC – Compact RISC-V System-on-Chip

This repository contains an **educational System-on-Chip (SoC) project** built around the **RVMYTH RISC-V core**, designed using Sky130 technology.  

### Inside this repo:
- **RTL & TL-Verilog modules** for CPU, PLL, and 10-bit DAC  
- **Testbench** for pre- and post-synthesis simulation  
- **Simulation outputs & waveforms**  
- **Images & diagrams** explaining design and results  
- **Scripts** for TLV → Verilog conversion and simulation  

Learn how to integrate digital and analog components, perform simulations, and verify a simple RISC-V based SoC.

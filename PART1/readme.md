# VSDBabySoC: A Compact RISC-V Based System on Chip

VSDBabySoC is an **open-source, educational System on Chip (SoC)** built around the **RVMYTH RISC-V core**.  

Designed using **Sky130 technology**, it integrates:  
- **CPU** â€“ RVMYTH RISC-V core  
- **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)** â€“ for clock synchronization  
- **10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)** â€“ for analog output  

This project provides a **hands-on introduction to digital-analog system integration**, making it ideal for learning:  
- SoC design  
- RISC-V architecture  
- Real-world applications like audio and video processing

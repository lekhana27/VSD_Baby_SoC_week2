VSDBabySoC: A Compact RISC-V Based System on Chip
VSDBabySoC is an open-source, educational System on Chip (SoC) built around the RVMYTH RISC-V core. Designed using Sky130 technology, it integrates a CPU, Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for clock synchronization, and a 10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) for analog output. This project offers a hands-on introduction to digital-analog system integration, making it ideal for learning SoC design, RISC-V architecture, and real-world applications like audio and video processing.
